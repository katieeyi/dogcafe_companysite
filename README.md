# Dog Cafe Website

## Objective:
- To build a basic single page that displays information for a Dog Cafe.


## Details:
- Will be using html, css, and JS.
- There will be a navigation menu that will be populated with the appropriate section names, based on the database provided.
- Additionally, when the user clicks on an item in the navigation menu, it should slowly scroll you to the corresponding section instead of doing the default jump.
- The section in view/active should also be highlighted visually in some way
